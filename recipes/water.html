        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Water is one of the few drinks that never goes out of style. I have fond memories of drinking water with my grandmother, on days when we were both thirsty. At least in my culture, this refreshing libation is always on hand no matter what the occasion: birthdays, religious celebrations – even at the birth of all my kids I had ice chips (the frozen version of this recipe).</p>

         <p>Palates of all levels of sophistication will enjoy water – I brought a pitcher to my family reunion dodgeball game and it was a huge hit! I’m telling you, as soon as players struck out the very first thing they did was head straight to my freshly prepared water.</p>
         <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Water</li>
                <li>Ice (Optional)</li>     
            </ul>
         <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Grab a glass from your cupboard. Be sure that it is not too large, nor too small, and most importantly, don't drop it, as it will break and everything you tried for will be ruined!</li>
                <li>Slowly bring the glass beneath your faucet. Be sure not to chip or break the glass on the faucet itself, as faucets have a much higher E value than glass on the Rockwell Hardness Scale developed by Hugh M. Rockwell in 1908.</li>
                <li>Turn on the faucet. Pay extra attention as to which knob you are turning. As one is hot, and the other is cold. Turn the cold one. This knob is usually marked with a C or the color blue. If you are red-blue colorblind, ask for assistance from a trusted source such as your Mom, or your Sister!</li>
                <li>As the water line approaches the top of the glass, turn off the faucet completely. Ideally, there should be a centimeter of space between the water line and the top of the glass. You can easily use a dime to measure this distance.</li>
                <li>If you want this glass of water to be extra special, you may garnish with ice!</li>
            </ol>
